    "## Why `AutoEmulate`\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations of real-world physical, chemical or biological processes can be complex and computationally expensive, and will often need high-performance computing resources and a lot of time to run. This becomes a problem when simulations need to be run thousands or tens of thousands of times to do uncertainty quantification or sensitivity analysis. It's also a problem when a simulation needs to run fast enough to be useful in real-world or real-time applications, such as digital twins. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emulator models are drop-in replacements for complex simulations, and can be orders of magnitude faster. Any model could be an emulator in principle, from a simple linear regression to Gaussian Processes to Neural Networks. Evaluating all these models requires time and machine learning expertise. `AutoEmulate` is designed to automate the process of finding a good emulator model for a simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the background, `AutoEmulate` does input processing, cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization and model selection. It's different from typical AutoML packages, as the choice of models and hyperparameter search spaces is optimised for typical emulation problems. Over time, we expect the package to further adapt to the emulation needs of the community."
