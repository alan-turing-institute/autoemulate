# Community

The AutoEmulate community is a group of users and contributors who are interested in the development of AutoEmulate. The community is open to anyone who is interested in AutoEmulate. The community is a place to ask questions, discuss ideas, and share your work.

We are currently building out our community infrastructure, but meanwhile we are very much welcoming contributions to the package. To get started, please read the [Contributing Guide](./contributing.md).
