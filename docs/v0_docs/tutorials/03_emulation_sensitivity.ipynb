    "## The Problem\n",
    "In the field of cardiovascular modeling, capturing the dynamics of blood flow and the associated pressures and volumes within the vascular system is crucial for understanding heart function and disease. Physics-based models that accurately represent these dynamics often require significant computational resources, making them challenging to apply in large-scale or real-time scenarios. Emulation techniques provide a way to achieve high-fidelity simulations of the cardiovascular system, allowing for efficient and accurate analysis of key hemodynamic parameters."
