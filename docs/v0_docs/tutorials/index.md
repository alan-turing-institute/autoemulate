# Tutorials

These are more in-depth workflows which cover all aspects of `AutoEmulate`, from comprehensive overviews of the features to strategies for minimising computation time with larger datasets or when using hyperparameter optimisation.

These tutorials are all Jupyter notebooks which can be [run in a local interactive session](../getting-started/installation.md#interactive-tutorials).

We also have [case studies](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/tree/main/case_studies) in the GitHub repository, which demonstrate `AutoEmulate` applied to complex simulations and real-world use cases.
