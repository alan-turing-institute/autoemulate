# Welcome to AutoEmulate

`AutoEmulate` is a Python library that makes it easy to create accurate and efficient emulators for complex simulations. Under the hood, the package runs a complete machine learning pipeline to compare and optimise a wide range of models, and provides functions for downstream tasks like prediction, sensitivity analysis and history matching.

## ✨ Why AutoEmulate?

- 🛠️ **Diverse Emulators**: From classic Radial Basis Functions to cutting-edge Neural Processes
- 🪄 **Low-Code**: Data-processing, model comparison, cross-validation, hyperparameter search and more in few lines of code
- 🎯 **Optimized for Emulation**: Optimized for typical emulation scenarios with small to medium datasets (100s-1000s of points) with many inputs and outputs
- 📊 **Downstream Applications**: Still early days, but we've got prediction, sensitivity analysis, history matching and more!
