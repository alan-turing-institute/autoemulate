    "# Active Learning with AutoEmulate\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll introduce **active learning (AL)** using AutoEmulate, demonstrating how emulators and simulators work together to efficiently build accurate predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Active Learning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "High-fidelity simulators produce accurate predictions but are computationally expensive. Emulators offer fast approximations but can be unreliable, especially in unexplored regions. Active learning intelligently selects informative simulator evaluations to maximize emulator improvement with minimal computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulator:** High-fidelity, reliable, expensive to run.\n",
    "- **Emulator:** Fast, inexpensive surrogate model, less reliable in unseen parts of input space, but trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Active Learning Policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **policy** $\\mathbf{u}$ determines which input points are evaluated by the simulator. At each iteration, based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Labeled Set ($\\mathcal{D}$):** Evaluated points from the simulator.\n",
    "- **Query Set ($\\mathcal{Q}$):** Potential points for evaluation.\n",

    "3. **Membership-based AL:** Learner generates inputs from the entire continuous input space.\n",

    "2. If emulator predictions are uncertain, the learner queries the simulator.\n",

    "1. **`mse` (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the average squared difference between the emulator's predicted outputs and the simulator's actual outputs before updating (fitting) the emulator. A lower MSE indicates that the emulator predictions closely match the simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`r2` (Coefficient of Determination)**:  \n",

    "\n",
    "   - An $R^2$ score of **1** indicates a perfect fit—emulator predictions exactly match simulator outputs.\n",
    "   - An $R^2$ score of **0** means the emulator is performing no better than a naive model that predicts the mean simulator output.\n",
    "   - An $R^2$ score **less than 0** suggests the emulator predictions are worse than simply using the mean output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`rate` (Query Rate)**: The ratio of simulator queries made to the total number of input points encountered in the stream. Lower rates indicate a more efficient learner, as fewer expensive simulator queries are needed relative to the number of inputs seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`n_queries` (Number of Queries)**: The cumulative count of how many times the simulator has been queried so far. Monitoring this number helps track the overall computational cost incurred by the learner.\n",

    "5. **`logdet` (Log Determinant of Covariance)**: Represents uncertainty in the emulator’s predictions, calculated as the log determinant of the emulator’s covariance matrix. A decreasing (more negative) log determinant typically indicates increasing confidence in predictions as the emulator improves with additional simulator data.\n",
