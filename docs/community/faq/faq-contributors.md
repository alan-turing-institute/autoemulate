# First-Time Contributors' Frequently Asked Questions

## Technical Questions

1. How is the AutoEmulate project structured?
   <!-- An introduction to the project's architecture and where contributors can find key components. -->
   * The key component is the `AutoEmulate` class in `autoemulate/compare.py`, which is the main class for setting up and comparing emulators, visualising and summarising results, saving models, and applications such as sensitivity analysis.
   * All other modules in `autoemulate/` are supporting modules for the main class, such as data splitting, model processing, hyperparameter searching, plotting, saving, etc.
   * `autoemulate/emulators/` contains the emulator models, which are implemented as [scikit-learn estimators](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/developers/develop.html). Deep learning models have two main parts: The scikit-learn estimator interface in `autoemulate/emulators/` and the neural network architecture in `autoemulate/emulators/neural_networks/`.
   * Emulators need to be registered in the model registry in `autoemulate/emulators/__init__.py` to be available in `AutoEmulate`.
   * `autoemulate/simulations/` contains simple example simulations.
      * `epidemic.py` is a simple epidemiological [SIR simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology).
      * `projectile.py` is a projectile motion with drag simulation.
   * `tests/` contains tests for the package.
   * `data/` contains example datasets from three fields:
      * cardiac1-6 are datasets from cardiac simulations in [Strocci et al. 2023](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011257)
      * climate1 is data from a climate simulation in [Holden et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0197-7)
      * engineering1 is data from a simulated cantilever truss design problem.
   * `docs/` contains the documentation source files. We use `jupyter-book` to build the documentation.

2. How do I set up my development environment for AutoEmulate?
   <!-- Steps to configure a local development environment, including any necessary tools or dependencies. -->
   See the 'Install from source for development' section of the [installation](../../installation.md) page.

3. How do I run tests for AutoEmulate?
   <!-- Instructions on how to execute the project's test suite to ensure changes do not introduce regressions. -->
   * We use `pytest` to run the tests. To run all tests:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

   * To run tests with print statements:

   ```bash
   pytest -s
   ```

   * To run a specific test module:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_example.py
   ```

   * To run a specific test:

   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_example.py::test_function
   ```

## Community and Support

1. Where can I ask questions if I'm stuck?
   <!-- Information on where to find support, such as community forums, chat channels, or mailing lists. -->
   * We use [Discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/discussions) for questions and general discussion.

2. Is there a code of conduct for contributors?
   <!-- Details on the project's code of conduct, expectations for respectful and constructive interaction, and how to report violations. -->
   * Yes, it's [here](../code-of-conduct.md).

3. How can I get involved in decision-making or project planning as a contributor?
   <!-- Explanation of how the project governance works, ways to participate in project roadmap discussions, and opportunities for contributors to influence development priorities. -->
   * We use GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/discussions) for general discussion and [Issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/autoemulate/issues) for project planning and development.
